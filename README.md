# Even Number Generator

This Python program generates even numbers between 0 and 1000 using two different methods. Method 1 utilizes a while loop to iteratively generate even numbers, storing them in a list, and then calculates the sum, length, and average of the generated numbers. Method 2 employs a for loop with a specified range to achieve the same result, computing the sum, count, and average. The program provides insights into different approaches for generating and analyzing even numbers within the given range.
